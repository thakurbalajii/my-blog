            <h2>Getting started with C</h2>
            <p>C language is a popular programming language that was developed in 1970 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.
                The C programming language was developed primarily to build the UNIX operating system. It is widely used
                because it is simple, powerful, efficient, and portable.</p>
            <h2>Features of C Programming Language</h2>
            <p>The C programming language is rich in different types of features. Some of them are:<br>
            <p>1. Procedural Language: C is a procedural language which means the flow of execution of each statement is
                performed step by step.<br>
                2. Platform Independent: C is a portable Language which means C programs written for one platform can be
                compiled and executed on another platform with little or no modification.<br>
                3. Fast Speed: C programming language is considered as one of the fastest programming languages. C is a
                compiler-based language so the program written in C language will be the fastest to be compiled.<br>
                4. Low-Level Memory Management: C provides the concept of pointers using which we can store the memory
                addresses. It allows the low-level memory manipulation in the language.<br>
                5. Easy to Learn: C is a simple programming language that is easy to learn. Moreover, it also helps in
                learning other languages due to the structural similarities.<br><br>
            <h3>C Tutorial</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>1. Introduction to C</h3>
            Any programming language is best learned by writing programs. As a tradition, we generally start programming
            by writing the Hello World Program. After that, we study basic language concepts and keep moving to the
            advanced concepts.<br><br>
            Refer to the article <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-language-introduction/">C Language
                Introduction</a> to start learning C Language.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>2. Basic Syntax of C</h3>
            The syntax of C programming language includes various rules that define the structure of C language such as
            how to specify statements, define functions, etc.<br><br>
            Refer to the article <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-basic-syntax/">C Basic Syntax</a> to learn the
            Syntax of the C language in detail.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>3. Variables and Data Types</h3>
            A variable is a name associated with a memory location to store data. A data type is the type of data a
            variable can store. Some common data types in C are int, float, double, char, etc.<br><br>
            Refer to the article <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variables-in-c/?ref=lbp">C Variables</a> and <a
                href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-types-in-c/?ref=lbp">Data Types in C</a> for more details learn
            Variables and Data types in detail.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>4. Operators in C</h3>
            Operators are the symbols that perform a specific operation to be performed on the operands. C supports
            various operators like arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, etc.<br>
            Refer to the article <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operators-in-c/">Operators in C</a> to learn
            about the operators in C language.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>5. Input and Output</h3>
            Input means reading data from input devices or files. Output means writing the data to the console or files.
            C Standard Library provides various input and output functions. scanf() and printf() are commonly used
            function.<br><br>
            Refer to the article <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-input-and-output-in-c/">Basic Input and
                Output in C</a> to learn about Input and Output methods in detail.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>6. Conditional Statements</h3>
            Conditional Statements are used to control the normal flow of execution of the program. These statements are
            used to make decisions whether to execute a specific block of code or not based on the specific
            conditions.<br><br>
            <p>
            <h4>The main decision-making statements in C are:</h4>
            </p>
            <p>1. if Statements</p>
            <p>2. if-else Statements</p>
            <p>3. if-else-if Lader</p>
            <p>4. Nested if-else Statements</p>
            <p>5. Conditional Statements</p>
            <p>6. Switch-case Statements</p>
            Refer to the article <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decision-making-c-cpp/">Decision Making in C /
                C++ (if, if..else, Nested if, if-else-if )</a> to learn Control Statements in detail.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>7. Loops</h3>
            In C, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code till a given condition is true. Loops are also a
            part of control statements just like conditional statements.<br>
            Refer to article <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-loops/">C â€“ Loops</a> to learn the concept of
            Loops in detail.</p>

            <p>
            <h3>8. Functions</h3>
            Functions are the block of code that is used to perform a specific task. It is a set of statements enclosed
            within {} braces. Functions make the code more readable and improve the maintainability of the code.<br>
            Refer to the article <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-functions/?ref=lbp">C Functions</a> for more
            details.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>9. Pointers</h3>
            In C, pointers are the variables that can store the address of other variables, functions, structures, and
            even other pointers. The pointer points to the memory location where the data is actually stored. Using
            pointers we can access and manipulate the data by directly accessing the memory where the data is
            stored.<br>
            Refer to the article<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-pointers/?ref=lbp">C Pointers</a> to learn the
            concept of pointers in detail.</p>
